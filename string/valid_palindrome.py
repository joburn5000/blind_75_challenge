"""
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase 
letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric 
characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric 
characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false 
otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

"""
Explanation:

After getting rid of non alphanumeric character using isalnum()
and converting to lower case, we check if the formatted string
is the same forwards and backwards
